# launcher
Makes a Launcher class to simulate how a ball travells. There are various ways of setting the initial velocity of the ball, and new ways to get relevant data will be added eventually.

driver.py shows how to use this, keep in mind that driver.py and launcher.py need to be in the same folder to play nicely with eachother
